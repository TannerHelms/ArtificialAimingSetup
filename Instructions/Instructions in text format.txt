[Info] Kernel-Driver Protection
________________________________________
Kernel-Driver Protection:

The Access Sp00fer & Chair.Net.Client comes with a new Kernel-Protection against AntiCheats.
You can activate this protection by clicking the Blue Shield   in the AA.Net.Client

The Kernel-Protections is optional, unless the Access Sp00fer & Chair.Net.Client tells you otherwise.

   



Error Message:

For this to protection to work correctly, you will need to disable a build in windows feature called patchguard.
If you don't disable patchguard the Access Sp00fer & Chair.Net.Client will display the following message.
This message will also display if the patchguard files are out of date. (re-patch your system if this is the case)

 



Supported Windows Versions:

The Kernel-Protection is compatible with the latest versions of Win7, Win8.1 and Win10.
Make sure your system is up to date by using Windows Update
(32bit versions of windows are currently not supported.)



Important Notice:

* Once you disable PatchGuard (and have a Patched Boot) you should ALWAYS load the Kernel-Protection first.
* So press the Blue Shield   before you start playing any games.
* If you did not load the Kernel-Protection before you start playing then AntiCheats might be able to detect that you disabled PatchGuard and kick/ban you for it.
* Once the Kernel-Protection is loaded it will hide the fact that you disabled PatchGuard.

* DO NOT PLAY ON GAMES THAT USE BATTLEYE WITH THE PATCHED OS, YOU WILL GET BANNED!
BOOT INTO YOUR NON PATCHED WINDOWS AND REMOVE THE PATCHED OS TO BE SAFE!

* Uninstall the patched OS and boot into normal windows when you want to play legit to avoid an anti cheat detecting you have a patched OS installed.


*Currently EAC games DO require the kernel, if this changes we will let you know.

SecureBoot must be disabled
Some computers have a feature called Secure Boot to prevent changes to the boot options.

You can follow this guide if you don't know how to do this.

So make sure you install all updates using Windows Update
Windows 10 users can also use this link to update.
If you can't update your windows because you use a pirated version, then we can not help you.

Code:
bcdedit /set "{current}" bootmenupolicy legacy
